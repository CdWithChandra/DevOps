# DevOps Tutorial
Master DevOps with this beginner's guide! Learn key concepts, automation, and CI/CD with step-by-step tutorials on essential tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git. Start your journey toward a career as a DevOps Engineer and improve your software delivery process

# GitLab CI/CD  Workflow
   GitLab CI/CD automates the code building, testing, and deployment processes, thereby ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

## Source Code Management (SCM)
-  Version Control: GitLab repository for code hosting and versioning.
-  Branching Strategy: Feature, develop, and main branches.
-  Code Review: Merge requests with code review process.

## Pipeline Configuration
Defined in .gitlab-ci.yml, the pipeline stages are:

- Build
- Test
- Deploy

Jobs are executed with dependencies and rules.

## Runners
-  Pipeline Job Execution Agents: Shared runners (GitLab-provided) or custom runners (self-hosted).
-  Executor Options: Configurable executors like Docker, shell, Kubernetes, etc.

## Artifacts
-  Job Outputs: Binaries, reports, and logs.
-  Output Persistence: Outputs are persisted for later jobs or downloads.
-  Output Management: Configurable retention and visibility

## Cache
-  Purpose: Speeds up pipelines by reusing dependencies.
-  Configuration: Defined per job in .gitlab-ci.yml.
-  Scope: Separate from artefacts and not meant for sharing build results.

## Environment
-  Deployment Targets: Defines development, staging, and production environments.
-  Configuration Management: Includes secrets and variables.
-  Release Workflow: Supports manual approvals and review apps.

## Triggers
-  Pipeline Triggering Options: Push, merge request, schedule, or API call.
-  Workflow Management: Downstream/child pipelines for complex workflows.
-  Integration Capabilities: External webhooks for integrations.

## Monitoring
-  Logging and Monitoring: GitLab CI/CD provides real-time job logs, pipeline dashboards for success/failure trends, and integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Final Reflection!
- Manages code, runs pipelines, stores outputs, reuses dependencies, and provides monitoring.
