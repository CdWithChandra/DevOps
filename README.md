**Here's is the Quick Start
**
GitLab CI/CD automates the code building, testing, and deployment processes, thereby ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Source Code Management (SCM)
	•	Version Control: GitLab repository for code hosting and versioning.
	•	Branching Strategy: Feature, develop, and main branches.
	•	Code Review: Merge requests with code review process.

Pipeline Configuration
Defined in .gitlab-ci.yml, the pipeline stages are:

- Build
- Test
- Deploy

Jobs are executed with dependencies and rules.

Runners
	•	Pipeline Job Execution Agents: Shared runners (GitLab-provided) or custom runners (self-hosted).
	•	Executor Options: Configurable executors like Docker, shell, Kubernetes, etc.

Artifacts
	•	Job Outputs: Binaries, reports, and logs.
	•	Output Persistence: Outputs are persisted for later jobs or downloads.
	•	Output Management: Configurable retention and visibility.

Cache
	•	Purpose: Speeds up pipelines by reusing dependencies.
	•	Configuration: Defined per job in .gitlab-ci.yml.
	•	Scope: Separate from artefacts and not meant for sharing build results.

Environment
	•	Deployment Targets: Defines development, staging, and production environments.
	•	Configuration Management: Includes secrets and variables.
	•	Release Workflow: Supports manual approvals and review apps.

Triggers
	•	Pipeline Triggering Options: Push, merge request, schedule, or API call.
	•	Workflow Management: Downstream/child pipelines for complex workflows.
	•	Integration Capabilities: External webhooks for integrations.

Monitoring
	•	Logging and Monitoring: GitLab CI/CD provides real-time job logs, pipeline dashboards for success/failure trends, and integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Final Reflection!
Manages code, runs pipelines, stores outputs, reuses dependencies, and provides monitoring.
